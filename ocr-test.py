# Plan:
# - Use NIST Special Database for digits and characters
# - MNIST for digits 0-9: https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
# - Need to get the rest of the characters. May use this for A-Z as a starting point: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format
# https://github.com/frereit/TensorflowHandwritingRecognition/blob/master/Preprocessing%20the%20data.md - extracting from NIST manually
